# Simotek - Theme
A theme by simotek who is really inventive with naming things provides a pretty simple prompt, with support [Git][] and [Quilt][].
This theme will also override the colors defined by fish_config with those set in the terminal emulator, to disable this behaviour rename fish_colors.env to fish_colors.env.dis

## Config

## Git prompt
The git prompt code uses an embedded copy of gitstatus.py from  https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt its license is in LICENSE.gitstatus-py.txt

## TBD
  * Put my sample color codes here
