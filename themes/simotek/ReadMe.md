# Simotek - Theme
A theme by simotek who is really inventive with naming things provides a pretty simple prompt, with support Git and Quilt.
This theme will also override the colors defined by fish_config with those set in the terminal emulator, to disable this behaviour rename fish_colors.env to fish_colors.env.dis

## Config
Adjust the user and hostnames to match yours in `simotek_theme.conf`, if you like this theme but would rather have slightly different colors you can modify them in `simotek_theme_colors.en`

## Git prompt
The git prompt code uses an embedded copy of gitstatus.py from  https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt its license is in LICENSE.gitstatus-py.txt

## Default colors
  * I'm lazy so a list of colors i'm using can be found at https://github.com/simotek/Enlightenment-Themes/blob/anti-transient-color/terminology/default_colors.in.edc
